# axona_preprocessing 

This folder contains scripts related to pre-processing the raw, tetrode and 
input files from the AXONA system, as read in using the `axona_io` 
functions.

The main purpose is to reformat the data into shapes that are more easy 
used when plotting key aspects of the data.

Note: these functions are working on the results contained in the `axona_io` folder
